# Darkfang Web Browser 

Your web browser is something completely unique to *you* - something you use every single day as you work, play, and communicate. 

With the browser being our window into the most important parts of our digital lives, it is imperative that your browser works **for** you, instead of against you. 

**Darkfang Browser** is a simple browser that aims to help you get more done, without you having to worry about sacrificing your privacy in the process. Darkfang includes: 

- A built-in *ad and tracker-blocker* so you can explore the web without being followed around by nosy trackers and annoying advertisements. 
- A *minimal UI* that stays out of your way and gives your content more room to breathe. 
- A *focus mode* allowing you to really drill down and **focus on the task at hand**. 
- Privacy-aware search engines that are user-configurable.
- A *dark mode* you can utilize for less eye-strain. 
- *Tab grouping* in the form of **Tasks** - so you can group your tabs together in ways that make sense for how you work.
- **Zero telemetry** - none. What happens in your browser, stays in your browser.

### Coming Soon...

We aim to continue to build more features into **Darkfang** so that you can continue to get more done with your browser.

More things we plan to build into the browser in the future: 

- Access to **NightshadeVPN** - a zero-logging VPN service that aims to be affordable, accessible, and open. 
- Easy **User-Agent Switcher** - in case you need to appear as if you're coming from another device. 
- Built-in **Tor Mode** - automatically send your Darkfang traffic over Tor for maximum privacy. 
- Built-in **Command Center** for communication on the web, syncing your work platforms, and other productivity tools - right on one page.
